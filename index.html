  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p style="text-align: left;">As a student currently pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Hyderabad, I am passionate about exploring the fascinating
    world of multi-threaded programming and its applications, with a particular focus on the exciting fields of Artificial In-
    telligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML). Throughout my academic journey, I have developed a strong interest in
    understanding how multi-threaded programming techniques can be leveraged to optimize computation tasks, improve
    system efficiency, and enable parallel processing. I am fascinated by the intricate interplay between threads, syn-
    chronization, and resource management, and I am eager to delve deeper into this domain. Furthermore, I recognize
    the immense potential of multi-threaded programming in the context of AI and ML. As these fields evolve and revo-
    lutionize various industries, the ability to efficiently process vast amounts of data and perform complex computations
    becomes increasingly crucial. By gaining expertise in multi-threaded programming, I aim to contribute to develop-
    ing high-performance algorithms and frameworks that can accelerate AI and ML applications, enabling more efficient
    and faster data processing, model training, and inference. I am eager to apply my theoretical knowledge to practical
    scenarios and actively seek opportunities to work on projects or internships where I can contribute to multi-threaded
    programming and its applications in AI and ML. With a strong foundation in programming languages, algorithms, and
    data structures, I am ready to embark on this journey of exploring the intersection of multi-threaded programming and
    cutting-edge technologies, making meaningful contributions to the future of AI and ML. Overall, I am a motivated and
    enthusiastic student with a keen interest in multi-threaded programming, AI, and ML.</p>

  <h2>Academic projects</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Workout Buddy</b></li>
    <ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
      <li>An application built in consideration of the COVID-19 situation, where people can track their workouts, evaluate daily workouts, and plan and track their exercise regime regularly.</li>
      <li>The project is completely based on the MERN stack, hence involves express.js and node.js for the backend and React.js at the frontend while using MongoDB for storing the data</li>
    </ul>

    <li><b>AnemiaNet</b></li>
    <ul>
      <li>Leveraging Deep Learning and Machine Learning for Accurate Anemia Detection.</li>
      <li>The technologies involved in the project are Python programming to develop various ML and DL algorithms and MERN stack for the webpage to deploy the algorithms.</li>
      <li> Anemia has become a prevalent disease these days, yet people are not serious about it, and one the reasons is a lack of awareness regarding the symptoms of Anemia</li>
      <li>We have aimed to create a highly accurate and easy-to-understand model that would provide a classification decision as to whether a person is Anemic or not by processing the <br>images of their palm, fingernails, and the conjunctiva of their eyes</li>
    </ul>

    <li><b>VocabVault: Chrome's Vocabulary Enhancer</b></li>
    <ul>
      <li>This project involved developing a Chrome extension that allows users to look up definitions of words directly from any web page.</li>
      <li>The extension uses API calls to retrieve definitions, and provides users with a convenient way to access this information without having to leave the page they are currently on.</li>
      <li>It is made using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.</li>
    </ul>

    <li><b>Denomination App</b></li>
    <ul>
      <li>It is a basic denomination counter app that allows the user to calculate the value of any denomination and also the total value of each denomination together.</li>
      <li>The app is built using ReactNative.</li>
      <li> It is a very basic app, which can be used by people on a daily basis. I have also built an APK of the app using Expo CLI in order to share and internally distribute the app.</li>
    </ul>
